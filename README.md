# phasmophobia-menu-fullstack
Heyo! This is a school project I had. The idea was to create a user / admin webpage using Firebase, and I had the idea of doing it using Phasmophobia as a reference.
* Backend: Firebase
* Frontend: CSS, HTML &amp; JS

# About
As a user, you can
1. Buy Items and equip them
2. Play (if you have more items equiped, probabilities of winning are higher). You can earn levels and money with this.

As an admin, you can
1. Create new items
2. Update items
3. Add money to users
4. Update daily and weekly challenges (decoration purpose)
